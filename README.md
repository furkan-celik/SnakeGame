# SnakeGame

Gameplay video of game = https://youtu.be/1fQRiSdUKWk

I made that game within 3 days of I got a macbook. Fastest idea to do was snake game but I did not want to do standard snake game. There is 3 enemy types added in this version. Standard enemy plays like player and competes with player, second enemy just able to go cross ways and it is a little dumb. And the third enemy is predator which aims to kill player before player kills it. When player eats itself in half, one of these three snakes spawns randomly and starts to play. Eating enemy in half and/or enemy's eating each other in half makes the same effect aswell. However, especially predator snake is very buggy, in sort period of time I could accomplish this much with learning swift and sprite kit of swift in remained time from my work.
